### Pizza Menu
This project is a simulation of an online pizza menu, it utilizes user input and returns the cost for the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is based on the classic game "Tic-Tac-Toe". It involves the user placing a game piece on the 9-slot 2D board, and trying to beat the computer by aligning 3 game pieces in a linear formation. The winner is then celebrated with a winning sound effect.

### Calculator
This project is a basic 4 function calculator, users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
